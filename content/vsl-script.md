## 0:00 - 1:00 | THE HOOK (The Calculator Shock)

**[VISUAL: Calculator results showing massive revenue gap]**

**SCRIPT:**

"If you're spending $1,000 on ads this month, you're effectively burning $700 of it. 

Not because your offer is bad. Not because your targeting is off. But because you're sending 80% mobile traffic to a landing page that was designed for desktop computers in 2015.

I'm [Your Name], and I've helped over [X] businesses fix this exact problem. And I'm about to show you why your current landing page is a conversion graveyard—and what to do about it.

**[VISUAL: Split screen - slow loading traditional page vs instant Perspective funnel]**

Here's what's happening: Your visitor clicks your ad on their phone. They wait 5 seconds for your page to load. They see a wall of text. They try to fill out your 15-field contact form with their thumbs. They give up. They leave. You just paid $3 for nothing.

This happens 70 times out of 100. Every. Single. Day.

Let me show you the math..."

## 1:00 - 3:00 | THE EDUCATION (Static Pages vs Conversational Funnels)

**[VISUAL: Animated comparison - traditional page vs Perspective funnel]**

**SCRIPT:**

"In 2026, there are two types of lead generation systems:

**Static Pages** - These are your traditional landing pages. Built on WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, even ClickFunnels. They're basically digital brochures. You scroll, you read, you fill out a form, you leave. Zero engagement. Zero personalization. Zero fun.

**Conversational Funnels** - These are interactive, quiz-based experiences that feel like apps, not websites. Instead of asking for your email upfront, they ask you questions. 'What's your biggest challenge?' 'What's your budget?' 'What's your timeline?'

Each question is a micro-commitment. And here's the psychology: humans LOVE answering questions about themselves. We hate filling out forms. It's why BuzzFeed quizzes get millions of shares, but your contact form gets 2% conversions.

**[VISUAL: Show engagement stats - 12% scroll depth vs 87% completion rate]**

With a traditional page, 88% of people bounce before they even scroll halfway. With a Perspective funnel, 87% complete the entire quiz. That's not a typo. That's the power of micro-commitments.

But here's where it gets even better...

**[VISUAL: Show mobile phone with Perspective funnel - smooth, fast, thumb-friendly]**

Perspective funnels are built mobile-first. Not 'responsive'—native. Every tap target is thumb-sized. Every transition is instant. Every question fits on one screen. No pinching. No zooming. No rage-quitting.

Your traditional landing page? It's a desktop site shrunk down for mobile. And your visitors can tell. That's why they leave."

## 3:00 - 5:00 | THE DEMO (Show, Don't Tell)

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side screen recording - WordPress site vs Perspective funnel]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Let me show you this in action. On the left, we have a traditional landing page built on WordPress. Beautiful design, great copy, optimized for SEO. On the right, a Perspective funnel for the same business.

**[Start timer - show load times]**

Traditional page: 5.2 seconds to load. Perspective: 0.8 seconds. Already, we've lost 40% of mobile users on the left.

**[Scroll through traditional page]**

Look at this. Paragraphs of text. Multiple CTAs. A navigation menu at the top. Social media links in the footer. Every single one of these is a leak in your funnel. Decision fatigue is real.

**[Switch to Perspective funnel]**

Now look at this. One question. One path forward. No distractions. No escape routes. Just pure conversion momentum.

**[Show quiz progression]**

Question 1: 'What's your biggest challenge?' - Tap an option. Instant feedback. Feels like a game.  
Question 2: 'What's your monthly revenue?' - Qualifying the lead in real-time.  
Question 3: 'What's your timeline?' - Understanding urgency.  
Question 4: 'Where should we send your custom report?' - Now we ask for the email. And guess what? They give it. Because they're invested. They've answered 3 questions. They want the payoff.

**[Show completion screen with personalized result]**

And here's the magic: Perspective doesn't just capture the lead—it qualifies them, segments them, and hands you a warm prospect with context. You know their challenge, their budget, their timeline. That's not a cold lead. That's a sales-ready conversation.

The traditional page? You get a name and email. Maybe a phone number if you're lucky. Zero context. Cold as ice."

## 5:00 - 7:00 | THE CALL TO ACTION (The Offer)

**[VISUAL: Perspective dashboard - show templates, analytics, integrations]**

**SCRIPT:**

"So here's what I've done for you.

I've pre-built a 'High-Intent Snapshot' funnel template for [your niche]. It's the exact same structure that's converting at 7-10% for businesses just like yours. You can clone it, customize it, and launch it in under 10 minutes.

No coding. No design skills. Just point, click, and publish.

And here's the best part: Perspective integrates with every CRM you're already using. HighLevel, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, Zapier—you name it. Your leads flow directly into your existing system. No friction. No manual exports.

**[VISUAL: Show pricing - 14-day free trial]**

You can try Perspective free for 14 days. No credit card required. Build your funnel, run some traffic, see the results. If you're not converting 2-3x better than your current setup, cancel. No hard feelings.

But here's what's going to happen: You're going to see your conversion rate double in the first week. You're going to see your cost-per-lead cut in half. And you're going to wonder why you didn't do this sooner.

**[VISUAL: Calculator results again - emphasize the annual gap]**

Remember that number from the beginning? The $8,400 you're losing every year? That's conservative. Most businesses see even bigger gaps once they factor in mobile friction.

Every day you wait is another day you're choosing to lose money.
